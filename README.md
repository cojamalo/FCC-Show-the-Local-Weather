# FCC-Show-the-Local-Weather
This is the repository for my completion of the freeCodeCamp "Show the Local Weather" project. Formatted for mobile use.

The project features AJAX requests to Dark Sky's weather API. It also uses the user's location info to find the local weather. Formatted for mobile use. 

A working version is at https://codepen.io/cojamalo/pen/LRWwww.
